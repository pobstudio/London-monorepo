## Packages

The LONDON repo is structured as a monorepo containing many packages that reach all aspects of the LONDON ecosystem.

| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`app`](/app)           | Core next.js webapp of pob.studio and HASH and lambdas                                         |
| [`protocol`](/protocol) | Core protocol of LONDON, contains the ERC721 token, minter contracts, and other future things. |
| [`sketches`](/sketches) | Generative art and a development runtime                                                       |
| [`scripts`](/scripts)   | Some administrative scripts to help with running POB (ie refresh opensea metadata)             |

## Setting up the monorepo

The `sketches` package depends on the `node-canvas` package which have external binary dependencies. Before running `yarn install` first consult the docs [here](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas).

In the root of the directory:

```
$ yarn install
```

### Running app

Visit the `app` repo and add a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID="1"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_KEY="ALCHEMY_KEY"
```

Setup an [alchemy](http://alchemy.com/) account and get an api key to be put in the .env file.

Walla! visit `localhost:3000` to see your build running locally!

### Running protocol

Visit the `protocol` repo and add a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
RINKEBY_NETWORK_RPC_URL="OPTIONAL"
RINKEBY_MNEMONIC="OPTIONAL"
MAINNET_NETWORK_RPC_URL="OPTIONAL"
MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY="OPTIONAL"
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="OPTIONAL"
```

Provide either networks corresponding url and key.

With `npx` you can run hardhat tasks like so:

```
$ npx hardhat deploy-nft --network rinkeby
```
